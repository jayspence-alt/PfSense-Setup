  Step 2. Virtualized Install:

    - I will be using VirtualBox, so I had to download the ISO and create a VM.  I also added 3 Network interfaces, 1 for the WAN(10.0.2.3/8), 1 for the LAN(172.16.0.100-200/24) and 1 for the DMZ (192.168.1.1/8).

    - Allocate at least 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, and 20GB disk for lab testing. - This has been completed.

  Step 3. Assign Interfaces:

    - Configure WAN, LAN and DMZ interfaces during setup.
